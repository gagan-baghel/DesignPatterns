when to use 
making very large no of objs



lot of time to make obj using new 
cloning---
for dealing with it we start cloning the previous obj( first obj ) 
making clone in java --- 
which ever class we want to make clone of that must implements
clonable interface with inbuilt clone function which return 
then this is necessart for that class to define clone function
if we dont define clone func it will show clone not supported func 

class demo {
	person p1 = new person();
	person p2 = (person) p1.clone();
}

-----
prototype pattern 
shallow copy -- sharing same file with authority (happen in prototype pattern )
deep copy -- seperated instance
