need ?
converting one interface/class into another
ex ---------------> lappy(charger) ----> need square shape pin  
and board is circular shape
( we need a adapter/converter from square to circular  )  ---intermediary--- ( my usb to c type convertor )
adapter accept square shape and give output as circular 

coding logic 
same we apply in coding 
we introduce conversion code in the intermediary class 
which take input from one and give output to second 
for example take int input and give string out if thats the need 




(Class to change)	   (class to make)		   (the class  for which we are changing )
Adapte --------------> adapter ------------------> Target
