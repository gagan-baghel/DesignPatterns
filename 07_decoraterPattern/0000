problem why --
if we want some addition topping we use decorator 
if some classes are constant and one is continously changing which pit its effect on  constant classes
then we use this pattern 

the deco patern attaches additional responsibility to an object dynamically
deco provide flexible alternative to sub classing to eextending functionality
( also known as decorator pattern )
